<!-- 
                I hear hurricanes ablowing. 
                I know the end is coming soon. 
                I fear rivers overflowing. 
                I hear the voice of rage and ruin. 

                Don't go around tonight, 
                Well, it's bound to take your life, 
                There's a bad moon on the rise. 

                (c) this is "Creedence Clearwater Revival", dude.
